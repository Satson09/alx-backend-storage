# MySQL 5.7 Setup and Usage Guide
If You're Using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):
Install Docker in WSL:
1. Ensure Docker Desktop is Installed and Running
Since you are using WSL, Docker Desktop for Windows should be installed and running. Docker Desktop integrates with WSL 2, allowing you to run Docker commands from your WSL terminal.

Install Docker Desktop for Windows:

Download and install Docker Desktop from the official Docker website.
During the installation, ensure you select the option to enable WSL 2 integration.
Start Docker Desktop:

Open Docker Desktop from the Start menu on Windows.
Wait for Docker Desktop to start fully (the whale icon in the system tray will stop animating).
2. Enable WSL 2 Integration in Docker Desktop
Open Docker Desktop Settings:

Right-click the Docker icon in the system tray (bottom-right corner) and select "Settings."
Enable WSL 2 Integration:

In the Settings window, go to "Resources" > "WSL Integration."
Ensure that your WSL distribution (e.g., Ubuntu-18.04) is enabled for Docker integration. Toggle it on if it's not already enabled.
Apply and Restart:

Click "Apply & Restart" to apply the changes and restart Docker Desktop.
3. Verify Docker Daemon Access in WSL
Check Docker from WSL:

Open your WSL terminal (e.g., Ubuntu 18.04).
Run the following command to verify Docker is working:
bash
Copy code
docker --version
If Docker is correctly integrated with WSL, you should see the Docker version output.
Run Your MySQL Container:

Now try to run the MySQL container again:
bash
Copy code
docker run --name mysql-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -d mysql

If your command successfully pulled the mysql:5.7 image from Docker Hub and started a new MySQL container named mysql-container. if the output you provided indicates that Docker was able to download the necessary image layers and start the container.

What to Do Next
Verify the Container is Running:

Run the following command to check the status of your container:
bash
Copy code
docker ps
This command lists all running containers. You should see an entry for mysql-container with the image mysql:5.7.
Access the MySQL Container:

You can access the MySQL command line within the running container using:
bash
Copy code
docker exec -it mysql-container mysql -uroot -p
When prompted, enter the root password you set (root in this case).
Interact with MySQL:

You can now run SQL commands, create databases, and manage your MySQL server as needed.
Example command to show all databases:

sql
Copy code
SHOW DATABASES;
Stopping and Starting the Container:

Stop the container:
bash
Copy code
docker stop mysql-container
Start the container again:
bash
Copy code
docker start mysql-container
Removing the Container (Optional):

If you no longer need the container and want to remove it:
bash
Copy code
docker rm -f mysql-container

## Overview

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up and using MySQL 5.7 within a Docker container on Ubuntu 18.04. It includes steps for creating a database, importing data, and executing SQL queries.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your system.
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**: If you are using WSL, follow specific instructions for running Docker and MySQL.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Docker

If Docker is not already installed on your system, follow these steps:

1. **Install Docker on Ubuntu 18.04:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker.io
Start Docker Service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
If you're using WSL, you may need to start Docker from your Docker Desktop application.

2. Pull the MySQL 5.7 Docker Image
Pull the MySQL 5.7 image from Docker Hub:

bash
Copy code
docker pull mysql:5.7
3. Start the MySQL Docker Container
Create and start a MySQL container with the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker run --name mysql-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -d mysql:5.7
This command sets the root password to root and runs the MySQL server in detached mode.

4. Access the MySQL Container
Enter the Docker container with:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it mysql-container bash
5. Download and Import SQL Data
Download the SQL File:

Inside the Docker container, download the SQL file using curl:

bash
Copy code
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/274/hbtn_0d_tvshows.sql" -s -o hbtn_0d_tvshows.sql
Create the Database:

First, access the MySQL CLI:

bash
Copy code
mysql -uroot -proot
Then, create the database:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE hbtn_0d_tvshows;
Exit the MySQL CLI with:

sql
Copy code
EXIT;
Import the SQL File into the Database:

Still inside the Docker container, import the data:

bash
Copy code
mysql -uroot -proot hbtn_0d_tvshows < hbtn_0d_tvshows.sql
6. Access the MySQL CLI
To enter the MySQL CLI:

bash
Copy code
mysql -uroot -proot
7. Run SQL Commands
Select the Database:

Once in the MySQL CLI, select the hbtn_0d_tvshows database:

sql
Copy code
USE hbtn_0d_tvshows;
Run SQL Queries:

Execute queries such as:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM tv_genres;
8. Running SQL Commands Directly from the Command Line
You can also execute SQL commands directly from the Docker container command line:

bash
Copy code
mysql -uroot -proot hbtn_0d_tvshows -e "SELECT * FROM tv_genres;"
Troubleshooting
Docker Daemon Not Running: Ensure Docker is installed and running. For WSL, start Docker from Docker Desktop.
Command Not Found: Ensure curl and mysql are installed and available in your container.
Password Issues: Verify that you are using the correct root password (root in this case).
Notes
All commands should end with a new line.
SQL keywords should be in uppercase (e.g., SELECT, WHERE).
